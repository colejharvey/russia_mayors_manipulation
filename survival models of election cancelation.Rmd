Converting data for survival models

Goal is a dataset with as many rows as their are cities, with DV as time.to.treatment, and other city-level variables as covariates.
-2004 urvoteshare, nonstandard coef and turnout coef
-Average mayor margin?
-poppopprop + lnAvgSalary + civsoc91 + 
-opp_mayor1? 

One way to to do this could be by election period.
I.e., did you have an opposition mayor during that period or no? 

```{r}
reuter.data <- read.csv("reuter_et_al_data_v3.csv")
reuter.data <- reuter.data %>% mutate(time.to.treatment = ifelse(is.na(cancel.year) == T, 13, cancel.year-1999))

```
